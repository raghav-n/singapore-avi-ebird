The previous record was from Island Club Road in 1989.  5 seen at Track 270, 4/12 (YDL).  December 2005 Highlights  Singapore  Residents of note seen this month included Red Junglefowl (Changi North, a new locality), Chestnut-bellied Malkoha (Bukit Timah), Glossy Swiftlet (Bukit Batok and Bukit Timah), Greaater Green Leafbird (Bukit Timah), Red-eyed Bulbul (Sime Road) and Yellow-vented Flowerpecker (Bukit Batok). Noteworthy though unconfirmed was a Yellow-eared Spiderhunter at the summit of Bukit Timah on 24""   Singapore Avifauna Volume 19 No 4     December 2005 also saw a potential new species being added to the Singapore List in the form of two Rosy Starlings at Changi from 29"" to 31°. This species was last recorded in the 1990s at Tuas but were thought to have been escapees. Their recent occurrence in Malaysia and other records in Thailand indicate that this species may be a regular if scarce migrant to our area. There were at least two Western Marsh Harriers at Changi up to 31° as well as a male Pied Harrier on 17"" and a female Eastern Marsh Harrier on 31°. Including Pied and Eastern Marsh Harriers and the starling, November 2005 saw the addition of 18 migrants to make 90 migratory species detected this winter. The others included Indian Cuckoo (Sime Road, 19""), Hodgson’s Hawk-cuckoo (Hindhede Nature Park, 11'""), Oriental Scops-owl (Sime Road, 19""""), Common Snipe (Chinese Gardens, 10""), our first Black-winged Stilt this century from Sungei Buloh on 22™, Common Black-headed Gull (Mandai Mudflats, 2""), Lesser Crested Tern (Kranji, 10""), Black Kite (Changi, 17""), Greater Spotted Eagle (Changi, 30""), Common Kestrel (Changi, 31°), Hooded Pitta (Bukit Timah, 3%), Siberian Stonechat (Changi, 4""), Sand Martin (Changi, 30""), Lanceolated Warbler (Punggol, 21°) and Inornate Warbler (Hindhede Nature Park, 24"").  Unconfirmed but exciting nonetheless was a Long-billed Plover at Changi on 26"", a second record for Singapore since the first also from Changi in 1990. Another 1990 rarity also turned up at Bukit Batok, this being the Thick-billed Flowerpecker. Up to 8 birds were present on mistletoes at this site from 17” to 20"". Also interesting was an apparent influx of Mugimaki Flycatchers at Mount Faber, Hindhede Nature Park and Bukit Batok, between 9"" and 18"". A minimum of 8 birds were present. Joining the spectacular Bukit Batok entourage was a male Jambu Fruit-dove which was present most of the month. Last but not least, a lone Chinese Egret was still present at Serangoon on 31%.  Johor     Records of interest from Panti Forest Reserve in December 2005 included Rhinoceros Hornbill (Track 270, Bunker Track), Black-backed Kingfisher (Bunker Track), Giant Pitta (Track 270), Plain Flowerpecker (Track 270). Nearby Hutan Lipur Panti also produced surprises in the form of Cinnamon-rumped Trogon, Malaysian Rail-babbler and Crested Jay.   Singapore Avifauna Volume 19 No 4     Singapore Bird Race 2005 Team Eagle’s Account  Low Bingwen  (This _ article Singapore)  is taken from  Wildbird  The 2005 Bird Race must have been without a doubt, one of the most productive bird races ever in terms of rarities recorded and on a more personal level, | have not really contributed any articles for some time now so | felt it would be great to give a summary of the thrilling events of the race. For the twitcher in all of us, | will write down all the rarity sightings | know of at the very back of this report, but for now, a summary of our journey to the title is in order.  It was a newdook Eagles team which stepped out onto the ""battlefield"" this year in more ways than one. It was the first time in at least 3 years that the team only consisted of 3 people, and also the ""Woodlands Kakis"" as | called them were not present this year. In fact, it was probably the 1st time our leader Kim Seng had to take a taxi home after our night's events.  In terms of sites visited, it was also the first time in years we opted to visit Lorong Halus on the first day instead of at noon on the  second, a decisive factor in clinching the title.  Stops at Marina South and Pasir Panjang Wholesale Centre were also new, and some pigeons would have seen us at Marina South where we managed 7 species in just 15mins. Otherwise, most sites visited remained unchanged and as productive as ever. Of special note is Changi which produced all sandy shore waders save the Grey Plover, and Sime Forest which despite inclement weather produced more than 40 species and another of Singapore Lost Wonders: Thick-billed Spiderhunter, 16 years without a record and only the second since the first been seen in Venus Drive in 1989 along with a supporting cast of stunners such as Brown-chested Jungle-  flycatcher (Kim Chuah & Ding Li), Eyebrowed Thrush & — Black-backed Kingfisher.  Night birding this year was also smooth with all the birds being where they should be with the only dips being Edible-nest Swiftlet and Collared Scops-owl. A_ roosting House Sparrow at Pasir Panjang & a small visible colony of Black-nest Swiftlets somewhere on Sentosa (Specific location is classified) made up for the 2 earlier dips.  On the down-side, it is sad to see habitat modification occurring so quickly — in Singapore and nowhere was this more apparent then at Punggol. In the short span of a few months, cars can now drive straight into the grasslands and this has almost certainly affected the birds with Greater Painted-snipe being much more secretive then usual and is now no longer present along the stretch of drain by the road- side(although the overgrown drain may have been to blame). Nevertheless, Jimmy has suggested paying some workers to go cut the grass in the drain to bring the ""shine"" back to Punggol. Anyone up for the idea?  On the lighter side, some more interesting snippets from the bird race would include the complete lack of novice teams at the reservoir on the morning of the 23rd which was a complete surprise to me, all of whom were probably put off by the new ruling that parking at Bukit Kalang would result in disqualification. It was also the 1st time in years that Kim Keang's team was the last to leave Sime Forest, unusual considering they usually left as early as 0930 (I know, because | was in their team before)).  Anyway, without further ado it is time for the rarities report. They have been classified by sites for easy reference. Like in most years, the Eagles pride ourselves in quantity, with flashes of quality in between. The point of this being most of the records mentioned are not by us, so please don't bombard me with location info for some of the more wide- ranging birds like raptors. Where applicable, the observers in question will be listed."

Not confirmed but of interest were several Himalayan Swiftlets reported from Sungei Buloh on 9"". Non-breeding visitors recorded during this month also included Jambu Fruit-dove at Bukit Batok, 2 records of Ashy Drongo from Pulau Semakau and Sime Road respectively, and potentially the second Singapore record of Oriental Hobby, recorded from Pulau Ubin on 28"".  Residents of note seen in a migrant-dominated October 2005 included Red Junglefowl (Pulau Ubin and Pulau Ketam, a new locality), Lesser Whistling-duck (Lorong Halus, Botanic Gardens), Violet Cuckoo (Sime Road), Drongo Cuckoo (MacRitchie Reservoir), Blue-crowned Hanging Parrot (Sime Road), Glossy Swiftlet (Bukit Batok), Buffy Fish-owl (Lower Peirce Reservoir), Malaysian Eared-nightjar (MacRitchie Reservoir), Greater Painted-snipe (Punggol), Malaysian Plover (Changi), Red-wattled Lapwing (Pulau Ubin, Kranji and Neo Tiew Lane 2), Grey-headed Fish-eagle (MacRitchie Reservoir, Bukit Batok), Crested Serpent- eagle (Nee Soon), Little Grebe (Lorong Halus), Greater and Lesser Green Leafbirds (Sime Road), and White+umped Shama (Venus Drive). The greatest rersident rarity seen were arguably a Thick-billed Spiderhunter seen on a flowering sea apple at Jelutong Tower on 23"" morning and a single Black-thighed Falconet at Bukit Batok also on the same day. In a month of low breeding activity, there were however seven breeding records.  Last but not least, the 2005 Singapore Bird Race conducted on 22""*.93"" saw the participation  of 12 teams and 42 participants, and logged a record total of 205 species, the highest in the event’s twenty-two year history."

November 2005 Highlights  Singapore  A potential new record for Singapore in the form of a Western Marsh Harrier was found at Changi Beach on 19"" and made it a good month for raptors. The second Short-+oed Snake- eagle of the winter was found at Tuas West Drive on 11"" and another report of a Black- thighed Falconet was made from Bukit Batok on 27"". Including the new harrier, November 2005 saw the presence of 10 new migrants, making 73 migrants in all. The other new migrants were Chestnut-winged Cuckoo (Sungei Buloh, 11""), Baillon’s Crake (Bukit Batok Avenue 6, 11""), Great Knot (Sungei Buloh, 6""), Oriental Pratincole (Changi, 19""""), Grey-faced Buzzard (Changi, 19""""), Chinese Pond-heron (Sungei Buloh, 10""), Blue-winged Pitta (Jurong Island, 3), Mugimaki Flycatcher (Mount Faber, 26' "") and Red-hroated Pipit (Changi, 19""). Ashy Bulbuls were still present with records from Bukit Timah and Sungei Buloh between 2"" and 12"". Another rare non-breeding bulbul, Streaked Bulbul, also turned up at Jelutong Tower in the Central Catchment on 26"" apparently attracted by the mass flowering of sea apples here.  Rare residents noted in November 2005 included Red-crowned Barbet (Sime Road), Oriental Pied Hornbill (Changi Beach, a new locality), Glossy Swiftlet (Bukit Timah), Spotted Wood-owl (Telok Blangah Hill Park, a new locality), Little Green Pigeon (Central Catchment), Red- wattled Lapwing (Pulau Ubin, where a high count of 24 birds was noted), Grey-headed Fish- eagle (Bukit Batok) and Greater Green Leafbird (Bukit Timah).  Johor  After a month’s absence, attention was focused yet again on Panti Forest Reserve where an unidentified fireback seen at Track 270 on 1* was probably | the highlight as were a female Besra and Finsch’s Bulbul. A trip to Pontian Mudflats on 27"" produced a count of 2 Lesser Adjutants and 10 Grey Herons."
