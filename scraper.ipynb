See also nesting report below.   A bird seen sitting in a cup-shaped nest in a tree about 2 metres off the ground with another bird in attendance at BBNP on 5/2 (LKS/SA). This was again observed on 7/2 (JC/LKC/LKS/OKS). On 19/2 (JC/LKS), 2 chicks were seen being fed by both parents a variety of food including 3 small Nephila spiders, 1 stick insect, 2 unidentified insects and 4 blackish berries (Clidemia?) over a one-hour period. The 2 chicks were still at the nest on 27/2 with 1 adult seen attendance (AC).  CA reported 4 birds on and near the nest on 14/2 and 15/2. It was not clear if all 4 were incubating but at least 2 went to the nest, calling loudly and taking small red berries from a low bush. On 25/2, CA noticed that the chicks were now well feathered with gold coloured caps. On 29/2, CA saw both chicks were oot of the nest.  At BBNP, the two parent birds were seen feeding one chick (with another probably nearby) on 8/3. The chicks were now almost as large as the parents but still obviously dependent on them for food. The plumage were also not fully changed. On 9/3, 1 chick was feeding on berries behind the old nest site and another calling nearby. On 10/3, their calls were heard from the old nest area. Records by CA.  JOHOR  1 at Panti Forest (Bunker Track), 16/3 (CA). This is the first record for this area.\n",
